Protip: it really hurts to have to your margin blown
#yolo is a valid strategy
Should have read more Zero Hedge
I blame the whales for this
"How do you want this trade to go" "Just fuck my shit up" "Say no more fam"
It's ogre
Protip: just do the opposite trade next time
My ancestors are smiling at me Imperials
That's a nice order but the best I can do is $2
Only casuals get liquidated

Shhhh no more tears, only dreams now
Palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms heavy, liquidation's on his sweater already
Do or do not, there is no try
It's not l-l-like I w-wanted to get l-l-liquidated or-r anything! Baka!
Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
WITNESS ME!!!!
They sent me to liquidation, I sent them to the Shadow Realm
* (With the sudden loss of your margin you are filled with DETERMINATION)
Never trade while inebriated
For what? Liquidate me for what? I thought this was America!
AAAAAAND it's gone
1 like = 1 prayerüôè
FUCK YOU DOLPHIN!!! FUCK YOU WHALE!!!
Somebody get this whale outta here
wtf i hate $SYMBOL now!
"Whale" a label created by traders to give voice to their destruction
Before us, you are nothing, your liquidation was inevitable
They didn't create the P&Ds. They merely found them. The legacy of my kind
Confidence born of ignorance, the cycle cannot be broken
Remember when I said I was going to liquidate you last? I lied
You exists because we allow it, you will end because we demand it
Nice try Captn Ahab
Show me on the doll where the whales touched you
I hurt myself today; to see if I still feel
‚ô´ How could this happen to me? ‚ô´
Pssh... Nothin Personnel... Kid...
Where we're going, we don't need stops
