Protip: it really hurts to have to your margin blown
Should have read more Zero Hedge
I bet the whales did this
"How do you want this trade to go" "Just fuck my shit up" "Say no more fam"
It's ogre
Protip: just do the opposite trade next time
My ancestors are smiling at me Imperials
That's a nice order but the best I can do is $2

Shhhh no more tears, only dreams now
Palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms heavy, liquidation's on his sweater already
If you had one shot, or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted
Do or do not, there is no try
It's not l-l-like I w-wanted to get l-l-liquidated or-r anything! Baka!
Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
WITNESS ME!!!!
They sent me to liquidation, I sent them to the Shadow Realm
* (With the sudden loss of your margin you are filled with DETERMINATION)
For what? Liquidate me for what? I thought this was America!
AAAAAAND it's gone
1 like = 1 prayerüôè
FUCK YOU DOLPHIN!!! FUCK YOU WHALE!!!
Somebody get this whale outta here
wtf i hate $SYMBOL now!
"Whale" a label created by traders to give voice to their destruction
Before us, you are nothing, your liquidation was inevitable
They didn't create the P&Ds. They merely found them. The legacy of my kind
Confidence born of ignorance, the cycle cannot be broken
Remember when I said I was going to liquidate you last? I lied
You exists because we allow it, you will end because we demand it
Nice try Captn Ahab
Show me on the doll where the whales touched you
I hurt myself today; to see if I still feel
‚ô´ How could this happen to me? ‚ô´

Don't lose your way
Where will you be when liquidation strikes?
Winning is too mainstream
Has trading gone too far?
For my next trick, I'll make this money disappear!
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
60% of the time it works every time
'Cause baby you're a firework

Was being liquidated part of your plan?
Well you got yourself liquidated, what't the next step of your masterplan?
A guy opens his position and gets liquidated and you think that of me?
Give them nothing, but take from them, EVERYTHING
You activated my trap card
You merely adopted to the water, I was born in it, moulded by it
Do you feel in charge?
Never go against a whale when LIQUIDATION is on the line
If I liquidate that position, will you die?
If you ain't whale, you're "little people"
Get out of the kiddie pool if you can't handle the water
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
You want the position? You can't handle the position!
His crime is attempted murder of a Whale, the sentence is death.
And you will know my name as THE WHALE when I lay my vengeance upon thee.
I hid this uncomfortable position up my ass two years
I'd buy that for a dollar!
It's a shame that this position won't live, but then again, whose does?
